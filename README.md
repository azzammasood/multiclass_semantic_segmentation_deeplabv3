# multiclass_semantic_segmentation_deeplabv3
Multiclass semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3+. Assign semantic labels to every pixel in an image. The Crowd Instance-level Human Parsing Dataset will be used in this project. It has 38,280 diverse human images. Each image is labeled with pixel-wise annotations for 20 categories, along with instance-level identification.
